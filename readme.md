This is a Python script that creates a Telegram bot to check the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, display charts of their price, and show the latest news about the crypto market. The bot uses the Binance API for price data and the CoinGecko API for news data.

The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, including requests, json, asyncio, telegram, and matplotlib. It then sets up the Telegram bot token and target price for BTC.

The check_price() function sends a request to the Binance API to get the current price of BTC and checks if it has reached the target price. If the target price has been reached, the bot sends a message to the specified chat ID on Telegram.

The start(), help(), and stop() functions handle the respective commands on Telegram. The chart() function retrieves the price data for a specified coin from the Binance API and creates a chart using matplotlib. The chart is then sent as a photo to the Telegram chat. The coin_price() function retrieves the current price of a specified coin from the Binance API and sends it as a message to the Telegram chat. The crypto_news() function retrieves the latest news from the CoinGecko API and sends the top 5 news articles as messages to the Telegram chat.

The error() function handles any errors that may occur while running the bot.

Finally, the main loop sets up the Telegram bot using the updater object and adds the necessary command handlers. It then starts the bot to listen for incoming messages and starts an infinite loop to periodically check the BTC price using the check_price() function. The asyncio library is used to run the check_price() function asynchronously.![photo1681246864](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101009145/231287540-37b2c364-3ac1-49b9-86cd-0b94efae2530.jpeg)
